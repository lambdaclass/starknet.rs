## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

üöß This project is a work-in-progress and is not ready for production yet. Use at your own risk. üöß

## üìñ About

`starknet_in_rust` is an implementation of [Starknet](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/tree/master/src/starkware/starknet) in Rust.
It makes use of [cairo-vm](https://github.com/lambdaclass/cairo-vm), the Rust implementation of the Cairo virtual machine.

## üåÖ Getting Started

### Dependencies
- Rust 1.70
- A working installation of cairo-lang 0.12 (for compiling the cairo files)
- [Optional, for testing purposes] Heaptrack

### Installation

Run the following make targets to have a working environment (if in Mac or if you encounter an error, see the subsection below):

#### Linux (x86-64)
```bash
$ make deps
$ make build
```

#### OSX (Apple Silicon)
```bash
$ make deps-macos
$ make build
```

Check the [Makefile](/Makefile) for additional targets.

#### RPC State Reader

In order to use the RPC state reader add an Infura API key in a `.env` file at root:

```
INFURA_API_KEY={some_key}
```

#### How to manually install the script dependencies

`cairo-lang` requires the `gmp` library to build.
You can install it on Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions with:
```shell
sudo apt install -y libgmp3-dev
```

In Mac you can use Homebrew:
```shell
brew install gmp
```

In Mac you'll also need to tell the script where to find the gmp lib:
```shell
export CFLAGS=-I/opt/homebrew/opt/gmp/include LDFLAGS=-L/opt/homebrew/opt/gmp/lib
```



## üöÄ Usage

### Running simple contracts

You can find a tutorial on running contracts [here](/examples/contract_execution/README.md).

### Using the CLI
You can find an example on how to use the CLI [here](/docs/CLI_USAGE_EXAMPLE.md)


### Customization

#### Contract class cache behavior

`starknet_in_rust` supports caching contracts in memory. Caching the contracts is useful for
avoiding excessive RPC API usage and keeping the contract class deserialization overhead to the
minimum. The project provides two builtin cache policies: null and permanent. The null cache behaves
as if there was no cache at all. The permanent cache caches everything in memory forever.

In addition to those two, an example is provided that implements and uses an LRU cache policy.
Long-running applications should ideally implement a cache algorithm suited to their needs or
alternatively use our example's implementation to avoid spamming the API when using the null cache
or blowing the memory usage when running with the permanent cache.

Customized cache policies may be used by implementing the `ContractClassCache` trait. Check out our
[LRU cache example](examples/lru_cache/main.rs) for more details. Updating the cache requires
manually merging the local state cache into the shared cache manually. This can be done by calling
the `drain_private_contract_class_cache` on the `CachedState` instance.

```rs
// To use the null cache (aka. no cache at all), create the state as follows:
let cache = Arc::new(NullContractClassCache::default());
let state1 = CachedState::new(state_reader.clone(), cache.clone());
let state2 = CachedState::new(state_reader.clone(), cache.clone()); // Cache is reused.

// Insert state usage here.

// The null cache doesn't have any method to extend it since it has no data.
```

```rs
// If the permanent cache is preferred, then use `PermanentContractClassCache` instead:
let cache = Arc::new(PermanentContractClassCache::default());
let state1 = CachedState::new(state_reader.clone(), cache.clone());
let state2 = CachedState::new(state_reader.clone(), cache.clone()); // Cache is reused.

// Insert state usage here.

// Extend the shared cache with the states' contracts after using them.
cache.extend(state1.state.drain_private_contract_class_cache());
cache.extend(state2.state.drain_private_contract_class_cache());
```

### Testing

[Add an Infura API key.](#rpc-state-reader)

Run the following command:
```bash
$ make test
```

### Profiling

Run the following command:

```bash
$ make flamegraph
```

to generate a flamegraph with info of the execution of the main operations.

### Benchmarking

Read the 'bench_integration.py' file to identify which lines need to be commented out for accurate results. Comment out those lines and then run the following command:

```bash
$ make benchmark
```
